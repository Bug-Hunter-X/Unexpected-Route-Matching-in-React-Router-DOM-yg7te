This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router DOM v6 where a catch-all route (`/*`) interferes with more specific route matching.  The problem occurs when the catch-all route unintentionally matches paths that should be handled by other, more specific routes.  The solution illustrates how to correctly order routes and handle nested routes to avoid this conflict.
